    comment: "Sars assaulted my boyfriend at ikeja. We didn't do anything wrong. They illegally searched our phones and computers and we complied. They later requested for money because they saw some foreign contacts on my boyfriend's phone and we refused. Then they seriously beat him up. He is currently at the hospital receiving treatment.",
